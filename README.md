# Laundry_Room_Website
This is the source code for a simple website meant to streamline service requests in my apartment building.

Currently, washers and dryers frequently don't work, and the app that the company has suggested tenants use doesn't exist.
The only option is a website form, and it requires a lot of extra info, and is very unfriendly to people who are ESL, a significant population in my building.

While this will be a simple task initially, I will be expanding the functionality to include more intutitive, interactive, and accessible options. Some of the enhancements to come are:
1. Interactive map of the laundry room to select which washer/dryer is not working properly.
2. Sending emails to relevant people, beyond making the post request on the website.
3. Expanding language options, primarily to Filipino, Hindi, and Amharic (Amharic and Hindi may be more difficult given the different typescript).
